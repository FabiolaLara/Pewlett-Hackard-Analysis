# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using Postgress and pgAdmin
# Overview of the analysis
The main idea for this analysis is determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

Throught the use of  some tables of information in csv type,  this analysis was made. Exploring these tables in PgAdmin and creating queries in order to get the necessary columns which will determine the scope fot the requested info.
The idea is to know the way this Company will be affected in their different departments if we filter by title field for each employee, so we can have an idea that there could be many retired people due there are many people in the Company and all of them have a title name, on the other hand there would certain people who can be eligible if they accomplish with certain criteria age.

The idea in this analysis is also, filter data in order to know the people who is working in their latest title field, due many people have changed of title.
